- Update camera class so its constructor takes in a camera name and passes it into PhotonCamera so its configurable
- Update camera class so we can pass in settings like camera position and angle per camera (cameraToRobot)
- Add cameraToRobot settings for other camera
- Create a second camera
- Make sure PhotonRunnable uses both cameras
- Make sure addVisionMeasurement(PhotonTrackedTarget target, double imageCaptureTime) is passed cameraToRobot instead of using hard coded one
